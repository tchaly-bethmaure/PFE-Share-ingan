# PFE-Share-ingan
PFE Project at ECE
Inspired by Shinigami-eye.
We present Share-ingan to create a toxicity-against community or maybe movement.

In fact toxicity and more generaly cyberbullying can cause serveral issue to people.

We try to respond to that problem a tool for social networks that can identify toxic people by their pseudonym.

It is a proof of concept (student project) and could become a real project.

Before that, we must check the juridiction of detaining such pseudonym and design a bigger architecture for welcoming tones of users.
